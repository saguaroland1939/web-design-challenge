      <a href="analysis1.html">Figures 1-3</a> depict the distribution of saguaro heights measured in 2013, 2015, and 2020. 
      For the purposes of this analysis, only the 525 saguaros that were measured in all three 
      years are included. Due to this, you can see that the distribution of heights generally shifts
      from left to right (smaller to larger) across the three years as the saguaros grew between measurements. 
      The tails of the distributions would appear slightly different if all measured saguaros were included due to the loss 
      of older saguaros and the acquisition/discovery of juvenile saguaros. However, some general observations can be made.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <a href="analysis1.html">Figures 1-3</a> show that the height distribution in all years is fairly bi-modal. In addition to there being quite a few 'middle-aged' 
      saguaros in the 10 to 20-ft range, there is also a large group of very young saguaros in the 1 to 4-ft range. 
      The Garden is a museum charged with maintaining a collection of educational plant specimens. The realities of
      plant collection work might partially explain this distribution. The Garden has built up and maintained
      its saguaro collections from field collecting trips, plants obtained from growers, 
      and plants received as donations from the community. Given the risk and great expense of tranplanting large saguaros, 
      collection efforts are focused on seeds and smaller specimen. The on-going acquisition of younger saguaros partially accounts for the large number of young 
      saguaros at the Garden. The dip in frequency between 5-10 feet may indicate that there has been a heightened level of saguaro collection
      activity in recent years.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      Another factor that might contribute to the bi-modal distribution visible in <a href="analysis1.html">Figures 1-3</a> is the fact that the saguaro population at the
      Garden is recruiting (reproducing). During the annual inventories, many new juvenile saguaros have been discovered by volunteers 
      as they grow large enough to emerge from the nurse plants and boulders that protect them. For the past eight years, 
      these "baby" saguaros, as they are fondly called, have been discovered at a rate that more than offsets annual saguaro
      mortality at the Garden. Therefore the recruitment of saguaros at the Garden likely also contributes to the bi-modal
      distribution. The dip in frequency between 5-10 feet could also be partially explained by lower recruitment rates in previous decades or lower
      survival rates for young saguaros. It would be interesting to compare the height distribution of the "wild" saguaro at the Garden
      to historical weather data for the past several decades to discover if the weather in recent years has been ideal for saguaro recruitment and survival
      of young saguaros.
