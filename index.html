  <h5 align="center">Introduction</h5>
    <p align="center">
        Phoenix weather made the news a lot this summer and record temperatures have the community worried about a possible threat 
        to our saguaro plantings around Phoenix and our iconic saguaro forests in surrounding desert areas.

                Phoenix breaks record for its hottest month, with 16 nights that stayed at or above 90 degrees</a>

    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.dbg.org" target="_blank">Desert Botanical Garden</a> has conducted an annual Saguaro Inventory since 2012. Every year 20+ volunteers and staff visit 
        each saguaro on the property to assess its condition. Height measurements are taken every 5 years. We obtained the full 
        historic dataset from DBG and performed basic statistical analyses find out if weather trends over the
        past several years have had a significant impact on the health of the saguaro population at DBG.

  <h5 align="center">Research questions</h5>
    <p align="center">
        <ol align="center">
            <li>
                Is there a relationship between saguaro mortality and the number of nights above 90 degrees in a year? 
                Cacti cannot "breathe" when the night-time temperature stays above 90, so we would expect to see higher 
                mortality in years with more nights above 90.
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there a relationship between saguaro growth rate and precipitation? We would expect to see higher 
                growth rates in the year(s) following a high precipitation year.
            </li>
        </ol>

  <h5 align="center">Data</h5>
  <p align="center">
    <ul align="center">
        <li>
            Historical Saguaro Inventory records were provided by Desert Botanical Garden from 
            <a href="https://www.livingcollections.org" target="_blank">A Living Collections Management System</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Weather data was purchased from <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#/login" 
            target="_blank">Visual Crossing</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Saguaro and weather datasets were cleaned up and reformated using pandas.
            The Jupyter Notebooks used to carry out this analysis can be accessed on
